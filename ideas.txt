I have a farming-esque game that works like this:

There is a spherical planet tesselated with 80 triangle zones.
The system is not realtime, and just makes time steps in "quarter days" (i.e. where the sun is shining on different 4ths of the world)
On each triangle you can plant a seed
Every trizone has environmental properties, such as:
- heat (with daily variance)
- weather patterns
- current weather
- water
- soil type
- material yield

depending on the properties of the trizone, you can plant a seed on it.
seeds need a certain amount of sunlight to sprout into full plants
seeds will not germinate and plants will die if the environmental conditions are not met
- heat requirements (low or high)
- water requirements (low or high)
- soil type requirements
- etc

plants may have an effect every quarter day, or may have an activatable effect

there are 4 main resources:
- sun points
- nitrogen
- potassium
- phosphorous

there are also materials that can be obtained in various ways and are used for crafting.

every quarter day you get 3 random seed types of various rarities (like opening a pack of cards) and get to choose 1.

trizones may be inhabited by monsters which need to be destroyed before seeds can be planted in it.

the player character is a plant mech where you can craft and swap parts out. 
the mech has various stats:
- hp
- power
- defense

the mech has a number of slots where weapons can be attached.
the weapons might be passive or they might grant attack options in battle.

combat consists of the mech and the monster taking turns choosing attacks to use.
attacks will usually cost some combinations of the 4 main resources to use.

the mech weapons can be crafted or upgraded.
various mech aspects can be upgraded as well as part of a skill tree:
- hp stat
- power stat
- defense stat
- number of weapon slots
- kinds of weapons equipable
- improved drop rates
- etc

trizones with monsters in them can be described as "hostile zones"
hostile zones adjacent to zones where you have plants have a certain chance every quarterday to spawn additional monsters (max 3)
if a hostile zone has more than 1 monster the extra monsters will try to attack adjacent plant zones
this will be a sort of second automatic mini combat system
plants will have a certain amount of HP and invading monsters will deal a certain amount of damage to them
if the spawned monster doesn't kill the plant, it returns to its spawn zone but the plant's HP retains damage
if the spawned monster does kill the plant, the plant is removed and the monster takes the trizone making it hostile again.
plants can optionally deal damage back. each combatant in this system only gets 1 attack per combat.
